                <p>Penguins are flightless birds, distinguished by their black and white plumage, resembling tuxedos. They are excellent swimmers, using their flippers to navigate through icy waters in search of fish. Living mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, many species thrive in the cold climates of Antarctica. Penguins are social creatures, often huddling together for warmth and protection.</p>
